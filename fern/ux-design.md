## Interaction Design Principles

1. **Immediate Feedback** - All actions provide instant visual response

3. **Contextual Help** - Tooltips and guidance where needed
4. **Consistent Patterns** - Same interactions work similarly throughout
5. **Forgiveness** - Easy undo, confirmation for destructive actions
